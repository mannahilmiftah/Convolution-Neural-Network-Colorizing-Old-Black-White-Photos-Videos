# Convolutional Neural Network-Colorizing Old Black & White Photos & Videos


# Project Description:
This project automates the colorization of grayscale (black & white) images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained on over 1 million color images to predict realistic colors, achieving results so convincing that humans mistook them for real color photos 32% of the time in tests.  

# Key Features:
- Converts grayscale images to full color.  
- Uses a CNN-based approach inspired by research from UC Berkeley.  
- Doubles as a tool for self-supervised feature learning in computer vision.  

# How It Works: 
1. **Training:** The model learns from a massive dataset of color images.  
2. **Colorization:** Applies learned patterns to new grayscale images.  
3. **Evaluation:** Tested via "Turing tests" where humans compared AI outputs to real photos.
